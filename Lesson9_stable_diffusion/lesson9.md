# Lesson9 Stable Diffusion

## Deep learning foundation to stable diffusion

### Free or not free GPU site 
1. Colab (free)
2. Paperspacesgradient(sould pay)
3. lambda lab(recently service, should pay)

### Wonderful web about generative art collection [Lexica](https://lexica.art/)
- you can search image that generated by AI 
- you can check what prompt that make image 

### Diffusers of hugging face: library for doing stable diffusion 

### how to use stable diffusion model in hugging face
- login huggingface 
```
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
from diffuesers import StableDiffusionPipeline

```
- making prompt what do you want to make? 
```
prompt = 'describe something you want to create images'
image = pipe(prompt, guidance_scale = <scale parameter>)
```

### what is the guidance_scale? 
- acutally model generate two images 
    1. image based on your prompt 
    2. image based on random thing
    - and the model takes average with two images 
- guidance_scale plays the weight of two images before taking a average 
> if you set guidance_scale 14 then model generate image based your prompt strongly <br>
> if you set guidance_scale 1 or 1.5 then model generate image based your prompt little bit 

### Negative prompt 
```
prompt = 'something'
pipe(prompt).images[]

pipe(prompt, negative_prompt = 'something that you don't want incloud the images')

```
- if you set negative_prompt = 'blue' then the image are non_blue images 


### image2image pipeline 
```
pipei2i()
```
- you can create what you want based on your input images 
- also you can make style transform 

### Fine tuning 

### Texture Inversion 
- you can create any style if you have a token of the style
